Hi, I'm Madison Doerr. I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Washington in the computer science department. In addition to school,
I'm an undergraduate researcher in the Makeability lab and the Personal Robotics lab. I love creating new technology and contributing to research, as well 
as sharing what I know through teaching!
